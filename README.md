Official website for WiDS Guayaquil (Women in Data Science). Built with Next.js 16, Payload CMS 3, and PostgreSQL.

Editors manage events, speakers, schedules, sponsors, ambassadors and blog posts from the Payload admin panel. Attendees register for the conference, the datathon and NextGen, and receive transactional email through a background job queue.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20.9 or later, as required by Next.js 16. CI and `flake.nix` both use Node 24.
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) — the version is pinned in `packageManager`, so use `pnpm`, never `npx`.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), for the local PostgreSQL database.

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

| Variable                                    | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `APP_URL`                                   | Application URL, e.g. `http://localhost:3000`                            |
| `PAYLOAD_SECRET`                            | Any random string, used to encrypt Payload tokens                        |
| `DATABASE_URL`                              | `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/payload` for local Docker |
| `REVALIDATE_TOKEN`                          | Bearer token the Payload hooks use to call `/api/revalidate`             |
| `ENABLE_JOB_WORKERS`                        | Whether this instance runs the background job queue                      |
| `PUBLIC_S3_*`                               | Endpoint, region, key id, secret and bucket for media storage            |
| `SMTP_*`                                    | Host, port, user and password for transactional email                    |
| `DEFAULT_FROM_ADDRESS`, `DEFAULT_FROM_NAME` | Sender identity for transactional email                                  |

Media uploads and outbound email need real credentials; the rest of the site runs without them.

### 3. Start PostgreSQL

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 4. Optionally seed local data

Run the seed script only when you deliberately want bootstrap content in the current database:

```bash
pnpm payload seed
```

For a clean sandbox, reset the volume first:

```bash
docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d && pnpm payload seed
```

`pnpm payload seed` is a manual operation and must never run in a production deploy.

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The site is at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the admin panel at [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin).

To preview transactional email templates instead:

```bash
pnpm dev:email
```

## Checks

Run these before opening a pull request. The first three are what CI runs.

```bash
pnpm lint        # eslint — a single warning fails it
pnpm typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
pnpm test        # vitest, once
pnpm build       # production build; needs PostgreSQL running
```

### Testing

Vitest runs in a `node` environment with no jsdom, so tests cover pure logic rather than rendered components — query filters, cache-tag wiring, email rendering, error mapping.

Tests live in a `tests/` folder scoped to the code they cover: `src/shared/tests/` for shared modules, `src/features/<feature>/tests/` for a feature. Use `pnpm test:watch` while working.

Anything needing a database — Payload access control in particular — is verified on the preview deployment rather than in CI.

## Payload Migration Workflow

Migrations live in `src/shared/lib/payload/migrations`. The baseline is `20260414_203346.ts`; later files capture schema and data transitions.

### Creating a migration

1. Develop normally — Payload pushes schema changes to your local database automatically.
2. Once a collection or field change is settled, generate the migration:

   ```bash
   pnpm payload migrate:create your-change-name
   ```

3. Review the generated files and commit them together with the schema change.

### The migrate prompt

`payload migrate` stops on an interactive prompt when it detects a dev-pushed database:

> It looks like you've run Payload in dev mode … data loss will occur. Would you like to proceed?

- Answer **no** during `pnpm build`. Answering yes makes Payload replay the whole chain against an already-migrated database, which fails on types that already exist.
- Answer **yes** only to apply migrations to an empty database, after `docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d`. That is also how to verify a new migration applies cleanly from scratch.

### Seeding versus migrations

Migrations carry schema changes and the data transformations needed to evolve existing records. `pnpm payload seed` inserts bootstrap content and is never part of a deploy.

## Deployment

Deployed on Coolify. The build command runs migrations first:

```bash
pnpm build   # payload migrate && next build
```

- Build command: `pnpm build`
- Start command: `pnpm start`

### Production safety

- Never run `pnpm payload seed` automatically in a deploy.
- Never run `docker compose down -v` against anything but a local database.
- Keep to a single migration step per deploy, so replicas do not migrate concurrently.

## Available Scripts
